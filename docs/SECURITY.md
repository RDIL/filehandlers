# Security Policy

Welcome to the security policy. Here we lay out details on the security of this project.

## Supported Versions

Right now, we are only supporting latest versions. If you find a security issue on an older version, we can't fix it.
If the issue is still present in the latest stable, we will fix it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT DISCLOSE DETAILS about the issue to the public until it is fixed.

Please send an email to `me@rdil.rocks` with details on how to exploit it, what it exploits, how you found it, and how severe you believe it is.

I will try to respond as soon as I can.
